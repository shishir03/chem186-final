# chem186-final

This is my final project for CHEM 186 at UCSD. Maybe I'll come up with a better name for this someday.

## Build instructions

If this is the first time setting up the project, run the following commands:
```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../src
cmake --build .
make
```

To run the program, simply run `./main` in the base project directory.
